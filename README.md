# local_suppliers
Toghether with the Gosh community we are trying to map local suppliers.

Initially we started with electronic components, but nothing stops people from adding whatever else they want (eg suppliers of 3D printers, suppliers for mechanical parts, etc..). 

Currently the best way to contribute would be:

1 - add to the file named "electronic part retailers" if you want to contribute with suppliers of electronic components

2 - create a new "comma separated value" file if you want to contribute with something else, eg. suppliers for 3D printer filament

If you are not confortable with github, open a new issue using this link https://github.com/amchagas/local_suppliers/issues, and put the information you would like to add there. State which file it should go into, or if it should go in a new file, and the content you would like to add. 

If there is too much too add, we might contact you and show you how to do it by yourself using github ;)

## Defining what is "Local":
- As nicely pointed out by @kasbah in #issue 2, we should include a more detailed description of what is considered a local supplier, so here it is (the definition is open for change!):
    -- All suppliers that are able to reliabily deliver a certain good, within a defined time-window should be considered a local supplier. By this I mean that even if a supplier takes 5 working days to deliver something to your door step, it should still be considered local, as the reliability would allow you to count on that deliver to keep going with your projects. Even better if they have "rush" option to deliver things faster for an extra delivery charge.

## creating a new file/new category

To keep things uniform, we suggest the use of the following categories:

Country, shop, website, obs1, obs2

More categories can be added after these in case necessary. 

#### Right now we started with electronic component suppliers, but we should create more .csv files with different categories! For example, if you know people who can deliver machined parts, or who can deliver 3D printers. By all means, make a new file and start a new list!
